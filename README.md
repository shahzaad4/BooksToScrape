This project uses BeautifulSoup and Selenium to navigate the website, scrape book details, and save them for analysis or further use.

## Features
- Scrapes book details including title, price, availability, rating, and more.
- Utilizes BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content.
- Employs Selenium for handling dynamic content and browser automation.
- Saves scraped data into a structured CSV file.

## Requirements

- BeautifulSoup4
- Selenium
- pandas
- ChromeDriver (or another web driver compatible with Selenium)
